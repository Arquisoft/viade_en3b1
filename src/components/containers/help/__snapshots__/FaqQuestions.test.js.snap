        What is a Pod?

        A Pod is where data is stored on the Web with Solid. (see quote). A user may store their data in one Pod or several Pods, 
            and applications read and write data into the Pod depending on the authorisations granted by the user or users associated to that Pod.

        All your routes, as well as the media files associated with them are stored in your own Pod. When you disconnect from our app,
            no data is stored on our servers.

        Can I store any number of routes in my Pod?
      </div>
      <div
        class="MuiBox-root MuiBox-root-10"
      >
        Yes, you can store any number of routes that you want in your Pod. To store a route, you can do it manually in
            your Pod, or you can use our app to create or even import some.

        My routes doesn't seem to load. Why is that?

      <div

        If you have a big number of routes associated to your account, you may experience load times bigger than usual. 
            Don't worry about that, if you wait enough, you will be able to see all your routes.

        ViaDeEn3B1's app only works with routes that comply with ViadeSpec's standard. This means that the application can only list 
            JSON-LD routes that are correctly built.

        You can only import GPX, JSON and JSON-LD routes. Those files may contain some errors, so they get rejected and ignored
            when trying to import them.

        Our GPX-import system is optimized specially for achieving interoperability with Strava's routes. This doesn't mean that
            you can only import files that come from Strava, but you may encounter some problems if your GPX file has an strange internal structure.
