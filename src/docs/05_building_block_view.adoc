The view is responsible of showing the user interface.

The model is responsible of interacting with the user`s pod an obtaining the data.

The controller coordinates both parts.




=== Level 2

Here, we take a look at how the different parts interact one with another. 

First, the user makes a request to our application. The controller is in charge of generating a response by means of the business logic.

Then, the model interacts with the user POD, manipulating the information according to the user request, and tells the controller to update the view.

Finally, the view shows the updated information to the user.

=== Level 3

3.1 Model-Controller interaction

When the controller needs the model to return an appropiate response, it interacts with the model service that, by means of a repository, will exchange information with the user POD.
