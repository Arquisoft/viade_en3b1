== Introduction and Goals

=== Requirements Overview

Nowadays, all the average social platforms for hikers are centralized and not totally secure services.
With Viade, we present a proyect that consists of a decentralized routes management system developed following solid specifications.

The main requirements are:

* The system will be based on a decentralized architecture where data storage is separated from the app.
* Users can store their routes in their own pods.
* Users can view the routes stored on a map.
* The app will allow a user to share pictures, videos or information about a route with other friends.
* A user can get notifications when some friend shares a route with him.
* Users can have groups of friends with whom they may want to share a route
* It should be possible to view routes loaded by users that are using a different app, so interoperability with other route management systems should be taken into account.

.Motivation
The objective of Viade is to give users a platform where they can share their taste and opinions about the routes they take, in a way that they can be sure all their data will be secure.
