== Runtime View

In this section, some use case scenarios will be described to indicate concrete behaviour of the application to a certain interaction.

This segment will be in continuous development.

=== Creating a new route

Users will be able to create a new route. To do it, an entire is designed to guide users in order to complete all the form in the correct way. Several data is indicated in this wizard, like the name, description, date, points on the map and photos or videos of the route.

=== Importing a route

In addition to the creation of routes, users can also import any route they want. To do that, another wizard, smaller than the previous one, guides the user during all the steps. 

Compatible types of files to import a new route are GPX, JSON and JSON-LD.

=== Listing routes

In Viade, the most important functionality is the visualization of routes stored in the POD of the user. This task, that seems very simple, is composed by several classes that act as handlers, parsers, and definitions of a route. Here, the JawgMaps API takes place, in order to ensure that all routes downloaded from the POD have correct elevation calculated.
