|Explanation

|Lack of time
|The amount of work required for this course project (7.5 hours per week) may prove problematic.
Even though the project is planned around the amount of time we have, it could end up as too large if we consider coordinating between ourselves consumes extra time.

|Licenses
|We have limited resources, and some of the licenses that could be interesting to try are not included in the ones provided by our studen accounts.
Still, the software itself is free, so this could be considered a minor inconvenience.

|Study materials
|There are a lot of technologies on this course that are new to us, and require us to find courses and books to study them.
There are some materials about them for free, but of course the best books and courses are locked behind a paywall.

|Coordination issues
|The problems that may come from working with other people, distributing the tasks and making code understandable by others somehow also limits the development of the project.

|Use of React Framework
|As we have no previous knowledge of React, its compulsory use limits using the web deveolpment techniques we are used to
