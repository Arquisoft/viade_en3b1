|=======
|Decisions |Advantages |Disadvantages
|JavaScript
 |Provides more resources for Solid.
 |Although it's used worldwide, it has several disadvantages, like the lack of a debugging facility, single inheritance and the client-side security.
|Solid
 |Protects user's privacy. Develop without harvesting massive amounts of data.
 |The lack of documentation for some things.
|JawgMaps
 | Allows to get the elevation of up to 500 points in a single request. 
 | The free version of the API doesn't support high traffic loads.
|Leaflet Maps
 | Open-source library to get maps implementation.
 | Needs other modules and libraries to get additional (and somehow obvious) features.
|Github
 |The version-controll system we are used to. Issue tracker, wiki, etc.
 | None.
