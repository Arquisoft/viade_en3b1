== Solution Strategy

==== Design Decisions

For developing Viade we will be following the next strategy (the necessary reasoning of our decisions is explained in section 9):

* Platform: Solid.
* Programming Language: JavaScript.
* Environment: NodeJS.
* (Continuous) Integration and Testing: Travis, Codecov, Codacy.
* Architectural Patter: Model-View-Controller.
* Libraries:
** Main library: React.
** POD access: link:https://github.com/jeff-zucker/solid-file-client[Solid-File-Client].
** Authenticate users: link:https://github.com/solid/solid-auth-client[Solid-Auth-Client].
** Map display: link:https://leafletjs.com/[Leaflet].

==== Quality Goals

Because of the participation in the Inrupt challenge, we will follow the Solid project principles:

* Freedom to decide where the data is stored.

* No change when switching between apps (modular design).

* Reuse of data.


Basic usability goals:

* Uncomplicated interface (visual route interface).

* Feedback for interactions between users.

* Portable to mobile devices (optional).


==== Organizational Decisions

We have agreed that the best way for developing Viade is following Scrum.

Functionality will be developed incrementally and at the end of every sprint (three weeks long) we will have working software.
